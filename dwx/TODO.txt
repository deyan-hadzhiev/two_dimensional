TODO:

1. Node based module system and UI with option for saving configurations (json?)
2. Rework module chain to work with float/double Pixelmaps internall to avoid precision loss between operations
3. Add alpha channel
4. Drag'n'drop pictures (and configuration for the node system)
5. Add GUI dark theme
6. Grayscale channels (both mean and natural intensity)
7. Implement Alpha color dialog (not sure if necessary)
8. Multi module selection
